# iccDEV

## Introduction

The purpose of the International Color Consortium (ICC) is to promote
the use and adoption of open, vendor-neutral, cross-platform color management systems.
The International Color Consortium encourages vendors to support the ICC profile
format and the workflows required to use ICC profiles.

The iccDEV project (formerly known as DemoIccMAX) provides an
open source set of libraries and tools that allow for the interaction, manipulation,
and application of ICC based color management profiles based on the 
[ICC profile specification](http://www.color.org/icc_specs2.xalter) and the 
[iccMAX profile specification](http://www.color.org/iccmax.xalter).

All documentation is in the "docs" directory. If you're just getting started, 
here's how we recommend you read the Introduction for a list of features and 
libraries included in iccDEV.
